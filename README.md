zulp
====

A small maze game for the Commodore 64


My motivation
-------------
In 2013/2014 I visited some really interesting retrocomputing events
in Berlin, and decided to write a simple game for the Commodore 64
in Assembler.
After colorflood was finished, I wanted to do a slightly more complex 
game and developed the idea of zulp.


Development tools
-----------------
I prefer crossdevelopment, because it's more comfortable and you get
a much faster turnaround. To be as independent as possible, I'm using
tools, that are available on all three important operating systems:

- VICE Emulator (for all main Operating Systems)

- Kick Assembler (written in Java)

- Ascraeus Font Editor (written in Java)

- Level Editor tiled (written in Java)

- The Level data compiler is a small script in PHP for the command line
 
- DroiD64 for handling D64 files on development machine (written in Java)
